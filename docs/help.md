## Introduction

Visual essays are web pages created from annotated text files.  The text files are formatted using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/),
a lightweight markup language.  The essay text can be annotated with simple tags that associate entities (people, locations, etc), images, maps, and videos with sections of text, typically paragraphs but can also be as small as a single word or as large as the entire essay.  The visual essay tools add interactive visualizations to the rendered web page information contained in the tags.

Visual essays are especially well suited for story telling that uses maps, images, and videos.  Adding a few simple tags to a text can result in an engaging web page that provides context and depth to the written text

The ability to easily associate text with maps and multimedia is useful but the real power in the visual essay approach used here is the ability to leverage open knowledge graphs such as [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) to obtain data that can be used for automatically generating information dialogs, location coordinates, image URLs, and other information about entities associated with a section of text.  At present the visual essays can use entities from both the Wikidata and JSTOR knowledge graphs.  Support for using other linked open data (LOD) sources may be provided in future versions.

## Essay markup

The essays are written in plain text and are formatted using Markdown.  Markdown has become something of a de-facto standard and is used by a number of popular web sites including Github, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and many others.  Markdown is a superset of HTML and as such any valid HTML is also valid Markdown.  In most typical uses a user will rarely need to augment the Markdown tags with HTML for text formatting as Markdown provides a rich set of easier to use tags for this purpose.  The visual essay processing code takes advantage of the ability to extend the Markdown tags with arbitrary HTML.  The visual essay directives to add maps, images and other visualizations to an essay are accomplished using a simple HTML tag with some custom attributes.  These custom directives and attributes are described in detail in the following sections.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight language that is commonly used to add simple formatting to plain text documents.  Markdown can be used to easily define section headings, lists, and text styling in plain text documents.  Markdown is also platform independent and portable.  It can be written in any number of tools ranging from simple text editors to full-featured integrated development environments.  There are also a number of good web-based editors available for writing Markdown.  More information on creating and modifying essay text files can be found in the [essay authoring](#essay-authoring) section.

### HTML

Any valid HTML can be used in markdown.  HTML tags are often used in a markdown document to accomplish custom formatting that is not directly supported by markdown.  The visual essay directives are also defined using HTML tags and can be specified using any of the HTML `var`, `span` or `param` tags.  While these tags are equivalent in their use as a "wrapper" for the visual essay directives and can be used interchangeably, this document will typically use the `param` tag as it is a self-closing tag and is more concise (and arguably a little more readable).  The `var` and `span` tags are not self closing and require an end tag (`</var>` or `</span>`) to be valid.  For example, the following forms of the `data-map` visual essay directive are equivalent.  One uses the `var` tag and thus also requires a `</var>` end tag to close.  The other form of the directive uses the `param` tag that does not require an end tag as it can be self closing.

```html
<var data-map data-center="42.2813, -83.7483" data-zoom="6"></var>
<param data-map data-center="42.2813, -83.7483" data-zoom="6">
```

In whichever tag form is used the type of visual essay directive is defined using a null value attribute.  This attribute can be specified anywhere in the tag but is typically the first attribute defined in the HTML wrapper tag.  A null data attribute is simply an attribute with the prefix `data-` and no corresponding value.  For instance, the examples above define a directive of `map` type with directive specific `center` and `zoom` attributes.

### Text Elements

Throughout this document the association of visual essay directives to text _**elements**_ are described.  A text element can be be a single word or phrase, a single paragraph, all paragraphs in a section, or even all text in the entire essay.  The placement of the visual essay directive in the document defines the type and scope of text element to which it applies.

It is common to add Markdown headings to documents to define sections of related content, and for longer documents nested heading levels are often used resulting in a document that is hierarchical.  For instance, consider the following document:

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Subheading 1a

Paragraph 1a1 ...

Paragraph 1a2 ...

## Subheading 1b

Paragraph 1b1 ...

Paragraph 1b2 ...

# Heading 2

## Subheading 2a

Paragraph 2a1 ...

Paragraph 2a2 ...

## Subheading 2b

Paragraph 2b1 ...

Paragraph 2b2 ...
```

This defines a document with 2 top level sections, each with 2 subsections that each contain 2 paragraphs resulting in a 3 level document hierarchy with a total of 8 paragraphs.
 
Given this document, a map associated with Paragraph 1b1 would only be displayed when Paragraph 1b1 was the "active" paragraph.  A directive is associated with a paragraph if the directive follows or precedes the paragraph text without an intervening blank line.

To associate a directive with an entire section the directive is located within scope of the topmost applicable section and includes a blank lines before and after the directive (and thus is not "attached" to any single paragraph).  In the example document above, if a directive was to be associated with an entire section, say section 1b, the directive could be placed after subheading 1b, paragraph 1b1, or paragraph 1b2.  Since it was defined within the scope of section 1b it would be associated with all paragraphs contained in section 1b.  In that way, when we say that a directive is associated with a text element we're referring to all text within the scope of the directive location.  In this example that would include paragraphs 1b1 and 1b2.

If we wanted to associate a directive with all text in section 1 the directive would be placed between Heading 1 and Subheading 1a making its scope section 1.  That directive would then be associated with the text element that included paragraphs 1a1, 1a2, 1b1, and 1b2.

Similarly, a directive defined before Heading 1 would apply to all text in the essay as the scope would be global since it was not defined within a section or subsection.

### Active Paragraphs

 An essay is comprised of one or more paragraphs that are often hierarchical based on the nesting level of the headings added.  As a user scrolls through a document a single paragraph is said to be "active".  The active paragraph is a paragraph in the top portion of the browser window and displayed with a visual treatment that identifies it as the active paragraph.  Any visualization components associated with the active paragraph are displayed in the visualization panel.  Multiple visualization components can be associated with a single paragraph.  In some cases the components are explicitly associated with the paragraph as the corresponding directive(s) were attached to the paragraph, and in other cases the associations are implied by the scope of the directive placement.  Using our example document above, if a directive was attached to paragraph 2a2 and another directive had been placed between subheading 2a and paragraph 2a1 both directives would apply to paragraph 2a2 and the associated visualization components would be visible and/or selectable when paragraph 2a2 was active.

## Visual essay directives

Visual essay directives currently include:

- [data-essay](#data-essay) - Essay metadata for defining title, banner image, layout, and other custom attributes
- [data-entity](#data-entity) - Associates an entity with an element
- [data-map](#data-map) - Defines a map to add to the essay
- [data-map-layer](#data-map) - Defines a map layer to add to current map
- [data-image](#data-image) - Associates an image with an element
- [data-video](#data-video) - Associates a video with an element
- [data-primary](#data-primary) - Identifies the content type to initially show when multiple are available for an element

### data-essay directive

The `data-essay` directive is used to define essay metadata.

#### Standard data-essay attributes

- __title__:  The essay title
- __data-author__:  The essay author name(s)
- __data-banner__:  A URL to a image to use in the essay header.  This can be an absolute URL to an externally hosted image or a relative URL to an image in the sane content 
repository in which the essay text is hosted, for instance `data-banner="images/some-banner-image.png"`
- __data-layout__:  One of `hc` (horizontal closed), `ho` (horizontal open), `vtl`, (vertical text left), `vtr` (vertical text right).  By default, essays will be displayed in a horizontal orientation with the visulaization pane hidden (__hc__).  The value __ho__ can be used to render the essay horizontally with the viewer pane initially opened.  The vertical orientation options allow the text location to be set to the right or left view pane.

#### Custom data-essay attributes

The `data-essay` directive can also be used for site-specific custom attributes.  For instance, the _**Plant humanities**_ project uses the following attributes to define values used in
a custom header:

- __data-num-maps__:  The number of maps used in the essay
- __data-num-images__:  The number of images used in the essay
- __data-num-primary-sources__:  The number of primary sources used in the essay
- __data-num-plant-specimens__:  The number of plan specimens used in the essay

#### Example data-essay directives

Below is an example of a `data-essay` directive defining a banner image (using a relative URL) and layout for the essay:

```html
<param data-essay
       data-title="Charles Dickens"
       data-banner="images/Viking_Bay_Broadstairs.jpg"
       data-layout="vtl">
```

This example illustrates the incorporation of custom attributes and an absolute URL for the banner image:

```html
<param data-essay
	   title="Cacao: An indigenous network and global commodity"
	   data-banner="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Cacao_Nacional_Fino_de_Aroma.jpg"
       data-layout="vtl"
       data-num-plant-specimens="1"
       data-num-maps="7"
       data-num-images="20"
       data-num-primary-sources="14">
```

### data-entity

The `data-entity` associates an element (again, anything from a word to the entire document) to an entity (person, place, organization, etc).  Entities are identified through the use of a globally unique identifier.  The current version of the visual essay tools assumes that entity identifiers are URIs that are resolvable in a publicly accessible knowledge graph.  Both Wikidata and the JSTOR knowledge graph are currently supported.  The entity identifier prefix for Wikidata is `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/`.  The JSTOR knowledge graph prefix is `http://kg.jstor.org/entity/`.  For both the Wikidata and JSTOR knowledge graphs a complete identifier consists of the prefix and a knowledge graph specific identifier that starts with the letter `Q` followed by one or more number, commonly referred to as a "Q" identifier or "QID".  The `data-entity` directive requires the inclusion of a `data-qid` attribute specifying the QID of the entity.  

Wikidata is the default knowledge graph used by the visual essay tool so it is sufficient to just use the QID as the value in the `data-qid` attribute.  When referring to an entity in the JSTOR knowledge graph the QID requires a namespace qualifier in the form of the string `jstor:` preceding the QID.  Namespacing is necessary as QIDs are not unique between knowledge graphs and the namespace (or prefix) guarantees a unique value.  Consider the country of France.  In the JSTOR knowledge graph the identifier for France is `http://kg.jstor.org/entity/Q10302`.  Simply using "Q10302" in the `data-qid` attribute in a `data-entity` directive would incorrectly to the Wikidata entity with the identifier `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10302` which is associated with _Sestriere_, an Italian comune.  To correctly refer to the entity for France in the JSTOR knowledge graph the `data-qid` attribute value would be `jstor:Q10302`.  While not required (as it is the default), QIDs for entities in the Wikidata knowledge graph may be specified using the `wd:` namespace.

Since `data-entity` directives are used so frequently they are the default directive type and can be used in an un-typed wrapper and simple `id` attribute can be used in place of the `data-qid`.  For instance, the following directives are equivalent:

```html
<param data-entity data-qid="Q10302" title="France">
<param id="Q10302">
```

In the interest of maintainability and future proofing the longer form version is recommended.

#### data-entity attributes

- __id__:  The directive ID.  If specified this should be globally unique within the essay.  If not specified a value will automatically be generated.
- __title__:  The entity label.  This has special meaning for location entities but is otherwise not used.  The actual entity label used in information boxes and elsewhere comes from the label property in the referenced entity.  Although the title is not used for non-location entities including a title is still helpful as a means to identify the purpose of the `data-entity` directive in the essay source text.  Essays will often include directives for many entities and the title field provides a convenient way for an author to see what is referenced.
When a `title` attribute is included in a `data-entity` attribute for a location the value of this attribute will override any previously defined label from the knowledge graph or external map data, such as that included in existing GeoJSON feature files.
- __data-qid__:  The Q identifier for the entity.  If not namespaced this refers to an entity in the Wikidata knowledge graph.
- __data-scope__:  one of `global`, `local`, or `element` - Defines the scope of an entity.  The `data-entity` directive is different from other directives in that it is by default global regardless of where the directive is located in the text.  The `data-scope` attribute can be used to limit this to the scope associated with the directive location.
- __data-aliases__:  When tagging entities in the essay text the text to match is defined by the label and aliases contained in the knowledge graph.  It is not uncommon for an entity to be reference in some other way in the essay text and the `data-aliases` attribute can enable the visual essay tagger to make the connection.  As an example, say the text is describing a location like Chicago but the text simply includes "the city".  To associate "the city" with Chicago include `data-aliases="the city"` in the directive.  Multiple aliases may be provided using a pipe (`|`) delimiter to separate multiple terms, for instance `data-aliases="the city|the windy city"`.
- __data-prefer-geojson__:  Location entities are automatically added to a map components that is visible for an active text element.  By default the location is represented as a marker pinned at a discrete geo-coordinate.  However, many location entities in the Wikidata knowledge graph can also be associated with GeoJSON shape files that represent the location as region using a polygon shape.  If the visualization of a location on a map using the GeoJSON defined region is preferred over a simple marker/pin this attribute is used to express that preference.

### data-map

The `data-map` directive indicates that a map should be added as a visualization component for the associated text element(s).  Maps can be further customized with `data-map-layer` directives that define layers or overlays to be applied to the map. 

#### data-map attributes

- __id__:  The directive ID.  If specified this should be globally unique within the essay.  If not specified a value will automatically be generated.
- __data-basemap__:  By default, [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is used for the base map.  Other base maps are available and can be requested with this attribute.  The available base maps are:

  -  [OpenSteetMap](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/#filter=OpenStreetMap.Mapnik)  
  - [OpenTopoMap](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/#filter=OpenTopoMap)  
  - [Stamen_Watercolor](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/#filter=Stamen.Watercolor)  
  - [Esri_WorldPhysical](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/#filter=Esri.WorldPhysical)

- __data-center__:  This attribute defines the center point for the map.  The center point can be defined as a latitude and longitude coordinates or using a QID for an entity that is associated with geo-coordinates.  For instance, the following are equivalent.  They both use the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan as the map center point.  In the first version the latitude and longitude coordinates are specified and in the second the Wikidata QID for Ann Arbor is provided. 

	```html
	<param data-map data-center="42.2813, -83.7483">
	<param data-map data-center="Q485172">
	```

- __data-zoom__:  This attribute defines the starting map zoom level.  This number can be expressed in 0.1 increments, such as `data-zoom="3.4"`
- __data-hide-labels__:  By default, the labels for any locations plotted on a map (both markers and GeoJSON features) will be displayed.  This attribute can be used to inhibit this default behavior.  Note that a user can still open the label by hovering over and/or clicking on the label or GeoJSON defined region.

### data-map-layer

The map shown for an active element can be augmented with one or more layers.  Two types of layers are currently supported.

#### data-map-layer attributes

- __id__:  The directive ID.  If specified this should be globally unique within the essay.  If not specified a value will automatically be generated.
- __data-type__:  `mapwarper` or `geojson`.  Defines the specific layer type.
- __title__:  The title attribute serves a couple purposes for map layers.  First, it is used a the label on map controls that enable/disable MapWarper layers and control the layer opacity.  When the layer type is geojson the title, when provided, will override any predefined labels in the GeoJSON file when displaying location labels on a map.  Note that when multiple features (and labels) are defined in a single GeoJSON file the title value will be used once for the aggregate features.
- __data-url__:  URL to a GeoJSON file.  This attribute is only used when the layer type is `geojson`.  This can be a relative URL (for example, `geojson/portugal.json`) if the geojson file is located in the same Github repository as the essay.  If not, the URL must be absolute.
- __data-mapwarper-id__:  Defines the overlay ID when the layer type is `mapwarper`
- __data-active__:  One of `true` (default if attribute is not provided) or `false`.  This attribute defines whether the layer is activated on the map when initially displayed.  In either case the user can toggle individual layers on/off using controls on the map.  

### data-image

Associates an image with a text element.  The directive provides the ability to define 3 versions of the image URL, the normal version (`data-url`), a thumbnail (`data-thumbnail`) and a high resolution version (`data-hires`).  The `data-url` attribute is required.  All URLs may be relative to the essay (i.e., 'images/my_image.png') or absolute.

#### data-image attributes

- __id__:  The directive ID.  If specified this should be globally unique within the essay.  If not specified a value will automatically be generated.
- __title__:  The title attribute is used for the image caption.  Markdown text formatting is supported in the title allowing for italicized and bold text.
- __data-url__:  The URL to the default version of the image.
- __data-thumbnail__:  The URL to a thumbnail sized version of the image.  If this is not provided the default version of the imaged will be scaled when a thumbnail is needed.
- __data-hires__:  The URL to the best version of the image.  This version will be used in the high resolution image viewers and automatically converted to IIIF format (and cached) for zooming and panning.
- __data-fit__:  This attribute defines how an image will be scaled or cropped in the image viewer window.  Possible values for this attribute are

  -  _contain_:  The replaced content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the element's content box
  -  _cover_:  (default) The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. The object will be clipped to fit
  - _fill_:  The replaced content is sized to fill the element's content box. If necessary, the object will be stretched or squished to fit
  - _scale-down_:  The content is sized as if none or contain were specified (would result in a smaller concrete object size)

### data-video

Associates a video with a text element.  Youtube videos are supported in the current version of the visual essay tool.  Other streaming services may be added in future versions.

#### data-video attributes

- __id__:  The Youtube video ID.
- __title__:  The title attribute is used for the image caption.  Markdown text formatting is supported in the title allowing for italicized and bold text.
- __data-start__:  The starting timestamp (in seconds).  If not provided the video will start playing from the beginning.

### data-primary

Defines the content type to initially display for an active element when multiple are available.  This directive uses the value for the directive type attribute to define the primary content type.  For instance:

```html
<param data-primary="image">
```

### Knowledge graphs

#### Wikidata knowledge graph

#### JSTOR knowledge graph

#### Entities

The data used by the widgets in the visualization pane is typically retrieved from Wikidata (the knowledge base behind Wikipedia).  Wikidata is a Linked Open Data (LOD) knowledge base containing nearly 90 million entities (as of mid-2020) and growing at the rate of nearly 1 million per month.  Each entity (person, location, organization, etc) in Wikidata is assigned a unique identifier commonly called a ‘Q’ ID as each of the identifiers starts with the ‘Q’ character followed by a number.  For instance, Washington DC is assigned the identifier Q61.

Connecting text to a Wikidata entity is accomplished by adding an HTML `param` tag to the text with an `data-qid` attribute the consists of the Wikidata QID associated with the entity.  For instance, to associate Washington DC with text in the document the tag `<param data-entity data-qid=“Q62”>` is added to the text.  The `param` tag is not displayed in the rendered text but provides information enabling the software to associate mentions of Washington DC in the text to the Wikidata entity with the identifier Q61.  Wikidata entities provide rich information enabling a range of visualizations and tools.  For entities that are locations (such as our Washington DC example) the Wikidata entity will often include geographic coordinates enabling the location to be visualized on a map.

When an entity is declared in a text using a `var` tag the software will use information in the Wikidata entity to find references in the text.  Wikidata entities include a label and optionally one or more aliases that are used to find the text references.  Additional aliases may be entered in the `var` tag to supplement those available in the Wikidata entity.  For example, if a document included the text “capital of the United States” the information available in the label and aliases properties in the Wikidata entity would be insufficient to connect that phrase to the entity.  In this case additional aliases can be provided with a `data-aliases` attribute in the `var` tag.  Multiple aliases are separated using the pipe (`|`) character.  For instance, `<var id=“Q61” data-aliases=“capital of the United States|the district”></var>`.

Other attributes available for entity declarations include:

- `data-scope` which can used to restrict the document regions considered when associating text with an entity.  For entity associations a `var` declaration is by default of **global** scope meaning that any mention in any part of the document is associated with the entity.  This behavior can be overridden by declaring an entities scope as **local** which would restrict associations to those mentions in the local region in which the `var` tag was defined.  The locality can be a paragraph or higher-level section depending on where the tag was entered.  To restrict locality to a single paragraph the `var` tag must be entered in the associated paragraph text block with no intervening blank lines and include the `data-scope=“local”` attribute.

#### Entity customization in visual essays

Using JSONLD ...

### Maps

Maps are added to the visualization pane using a `data-map` directive.  The visual essay tools use the [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) javascript library for map rendering.  Leaflet is a popular open source code library for generating interactive maps.

### Map layers

Maps may include optional layers.  MapWarper tiles and GeoJSON feature layers are currently supported.

#### MapWarper tile layers

MapWarper is an open source tool and online service that generates map tiles from image files.  A common use case for this is to overlay an historical map on base map tiles.  MapWarper provides tools for fitting an image to base map geo-coordinates by relating map feature points.

#### GeoJSON feature layers

Add a discussion of GeoJSON here.

## Essay Authoring

Since both the essay and annotations are plain text the essays can be created and maintained in any number of ways.  The only requirement is that the essay file be available on the internet.  One possible approach is to host the essay files in a [Github](https://github.com) repository.  Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Torvalds—the same person who created the Linux operating system.  Github is an online service providing hosting of Git code repositories.  Since its inception Github has become wildly popular and is often used for much more than just version control on software projects.  Github offers free accounts and while its user interface may initially be a little intimidating to non-technical users it is actually a pretty simple to use service and a convenient way to manage text files.  When coupled with Github enabled tools much (or all) of the actual interaction with the Github service is handled through more user-friendly and familiar interfaces.  One such tool is [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) which provides a browser-based Markdown editor with options for publishing files directly to Github.  [This page](/stackedit-setup) provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a StackEdit environment for publishing files to Github.

The `visual essays` service creates an interactive web page merging text content with external data, including:

- information from knowledge graphs such as [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org),
- maps with optional tile layers and geojson features

The text content is written in plain text with [markdown]([https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)) or [wikitext]([https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext_examples](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext_examples)) markup for simple formatting.  External data is linked to the text through the addition of HTML `var` tags that provide instructions and hints adding contextualized interactive features in the rendered page.

Initially, the rendered page only displays the formatted text content.  Interactive features are enabled when page sections are selected.  Selecting a page section (generally a paragraph) be clicking on the text will open a visualization pane in the lower section of the page.

When the visualization pane is enabled supplemental information associated with the corresponding text in the top portion of the page is available for viewing and in many cases interactive.  For example, if a location is mentioned in the text a map could be displayed showing the location of the place mentioned on an interactive map.  As another example, if a person is mentioned in the text more information (including images) can be displayed providing context and background on the person mentioned.

## Custom Sites

A visual essay is a simply a plain text file that is rendered as an interactive web page.  The interactive features enabled to the web page are created and configured using HTML tags that are add
